I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Computational Science Lab](https://uva.computationalscience.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam. I studied Mathematics at Padua University for my BSc and Leiden University for my MSc. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Sheffield with a thesis on "Mathematical and Computational Modelling of Arterial Mechanobiology: Application to Cerebral Vasospasm". Before joining the University of Amsterdam, I held a postdoc position at the Department of Cardiovascular Disease at the University of Sheffield, working within the [INSIGNEO Institue for in silico Medicine](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/insigneo) and the [SANO Centre for Computational Personalized Medicine](https://sano.science/). 

My main research interest is computational multi-scale modelling of the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems. I developed a mechanobiologically motivated model of cerebral vasospasm to help improve treatment selection. I also worked on numerical methods for medical image processing and 3D geometry reconstruction, as well as contribute to the development of a digital phantom of coronary arteries to standardise validation of computational models of coronary physiology. 

I am also part of the [EDITH](https://www.edith-csa.eu/) project, a EU-funded consortium to foster the adoption of digital twins in healthcare and thus realise true personalised medicine, and the [GEMINI](https://dth-gemini.eu/) project for the development of digital twins for the personalised treatment of ischemic and haemorrhagic stroke.
